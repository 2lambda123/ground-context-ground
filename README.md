# Ground

Ground is an open-source data context service under development at UC Berkeley.
Ground is motivated by our experiences with users of open-source data
processing packages like Spark, Hadoop, and Jupyter, and the software vendors
that provide tools and services in those ecosystems. We have repeatedly heard
requests in those communities for a flexible, vendor-neutral, open-source
context service. We believe that an effective service in this space will go
beyond just metadata and support data context. See our [Strata San Jose 16
talk](https://speakerdeck.com/vikrams/grounding-big-data) for more on data
context and our goals.

See [our writing repository](https://github.com/ground-context/writing) for
more about the vision driving Ground. Updates and announcements will be made on
our [website](http://www.ground-context.org).
